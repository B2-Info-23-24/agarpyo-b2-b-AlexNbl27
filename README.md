# Agarpyo
Agarpyo is a game inspired by Agar.io which allows you to play solo with the aim of achieving the best possible score within a given time. To gain points, you have to eat foods.

# Installation

## üë®‚Äçüíª Prerequisites
- Git
- Anaconda Navigator

## üéØ Installation step by step (on Windows)
1. **Clone the project where you want it to be**
```
https://github.com/B2-Info-23-24/agarpyo-b2-b-AlexNbl27.git
```
üí° I recommend to clone the folder in `Downloads`

2. **Rename the created folder**
```
mv agarpyo-b2-b-AlexNbl27 agarpyo-noblet
```
3. **Move into the renamed folder**
```
cd agarpyo-noblet
```
4. **Open Anaconda Navigator**

5. **Import the python environment**
<br>In the application, go to the tab `Environements`. Then, you should see a button `Import`  at the bottom of the window. Click on it. A popup appears. Click on the folder icon just under the text `Local Drive`. The Windows explorer opens. Now, you have to find the location where you put the folder `agarpyo`. Once you find it, open it and click on the file `agarpyo_env.yaml`. Finally, click on the `Import` button.

6. **Open the environment**
<br> Once the python environment is imported, go to the tab `Home`. Make sure to change the current environment to `agarpyo_env`. You should read : *All applications on agarpyo_env*. If it is correct, you can now install (or launch if already installed) the `CMD.exe Prompt` by clicking on the button `Install`.

7. **Move to project folder location**
<br>This is the step where you have to do it a little bit by yourself. In the command prompt, you have to navigate to the location where you put the folder `agarpyo-noblet`. You can use these two commands :
- Navigate inside a folder
```
cd folder_name
```
- Navigate to previous location :
```
cd ..
```
üí° If you followed my recommendation and you put the cloned folder into `Downloads`, you normally just have to type the following command :
```
cd Downloads/agarpyo-noblet
```
Once you finally found the folder, you should see a line like that in your command prompt :
```
(agarpyo_env) C:<path>\Agarpyo>
```
`<path>` should be the rest of your path before your folder's location. If you enter the following command, you should see all these files and folders :
```
dir
```
```

05/02/2024  21:14    <DIR>          .vscode

```

8. **Launch the project**
```
python App/main.py
```

**Here we go! Agarpyo is yours ü•≥**
